### `In case a pledge isn't visible on project page`
It may happen that a pledge created by a designer doesn't show up after returning to dashboard from creating the pledge. If this happens, it should update when:
1. A new pledge is created, or
2. The project is launched

### `Reaping successful projects`
Successful projects past the deadline are not reaped by the Admin. These are still visible in searches.
